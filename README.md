# Decision-tree-Gomoku
Machine learning applied to Gomoku game

This was the side project I developed when I worked in a company--2018.  
It staterd because I cannot make alpha-Go as personal project, 
so I made Gomoku--simpler version of Go-- instead with decision tree(white box) method of ML. 

What it does is quite simple and intuitive. 

1. Computers place the stone randomly. (practice phase)
2. The process and the result is saved in mysql storage through server.py. 
3. After practice, they use the winning tactics to win the game (testing phase)


There are some limitations and need improvements.
